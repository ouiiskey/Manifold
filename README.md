A vanilla-style Balatro mod.

## About
This mod is intended to preserve vanilla balance while adding new content. I recommend you play without using `Unlock All`. For more information, see the [wiki](https://balatromods.miraheze.org/wiki/Manifold).

## Installing
1. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).
2. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/ouiiskey/Manifold/releases).
3. Extract the zip in your `Mods` folder.
